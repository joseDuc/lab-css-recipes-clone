            This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
            be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of
            your
            favorites as well!

          <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water,
                white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
                to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</li>
              <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
                slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
                that it does not run off.</li>
              <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
                degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
